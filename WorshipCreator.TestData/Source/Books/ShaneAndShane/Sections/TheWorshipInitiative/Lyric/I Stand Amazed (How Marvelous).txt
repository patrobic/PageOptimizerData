I Stand Amazed (How Marvelous)


Verse 1
I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene
And wonder how He could love me
A sinner condemned unclean


Chorus
(Singin') (Ev'rybody singin')
How marvelous how wonderful
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous how wonderful
Is my Savior's love for me


Verse 2
He took my sins and my sorrows
He made them His very own
(And) He bore the burden to Calvary
And suffered and died alone


Verse 3
And with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see
It will be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me
