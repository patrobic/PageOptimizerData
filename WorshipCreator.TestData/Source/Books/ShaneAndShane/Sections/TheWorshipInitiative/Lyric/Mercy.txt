Mercy


Verse 1
I will kneel in the dust at the foot of the cross
Where mercy paid for me
Where the wrath I deserve it is gone it has passed
Your blood has hidden me


Chorus 1
Mercy mercy as endless as the sea
I'll sing Your hallelujah for all eternity


Verse 2
We will lift up the cup and the bread we will break
Remembering Your love
We were fallen from grace but You took all our shame
And nailed it to a cross


Chorus 2
May I never lose the wonder
O the wonder of Your mercy
May I sing Your hallelujah hallelujah
Amen
(REPEAT)


Ending
I will kneel in the dust at the foot of the cross
Where mercy paid for me
