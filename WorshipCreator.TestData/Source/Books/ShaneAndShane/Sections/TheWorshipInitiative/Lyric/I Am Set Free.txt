I Am Set Free


Verse
You broke my chains of sin and shame
And You covered me with grace
You mend my life with Your holy fire
You cover me with grace
And You are the hand that reaches out to save


Chorus
(And) I am set free oh
I am set free oh
It is for freedom that I am set free


Bridge
(And) yes Lord we are grateful for Your grace
And for Your love
(REPEAT)

'Cause You are the hand that reaches out to save
