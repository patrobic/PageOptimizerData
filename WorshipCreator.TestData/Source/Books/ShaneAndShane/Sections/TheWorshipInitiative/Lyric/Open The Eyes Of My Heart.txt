Open The Eyes Of My Heart


Chorus
Open the eyes of my heart Lord
Open the eyes of my heart
I want to see You
I want to see You


Verse
To see You high and lifted up
Shining in the light of Your glory
Pour out Your power and love
As we sing holy holy holy


Bridge
Holy holy holy
Holy holy holy
Holy holy holy
I want to see You
