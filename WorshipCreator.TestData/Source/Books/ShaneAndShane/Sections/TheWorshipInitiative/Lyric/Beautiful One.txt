Beautiful One


Verse 1
Wonderful so wonderful is Your unfailing love
Your cross has spoken mercy over me
No eye has seen no ear has heard
No heart could fully know
How glorious how beautiful You are


Chorus
Beautiful One I love You
Beautiful One I adore
Beautiful One my soul must sing


Verse 2
Powerful so powerful Your glory fills the skies
Your mighty works displayed for all to see
The beauty of Your majesty awakes my heart to sing
How marvelous how wonderful You are


Bridge
You opened my eyes to Your wonders anew
You captured my heart with this love
'Cause nothing on earth is as beautiful as You


Bridge
My soul my soul must sing
My soul my soul must sing
My soul my soul must sing
Beautiful One
