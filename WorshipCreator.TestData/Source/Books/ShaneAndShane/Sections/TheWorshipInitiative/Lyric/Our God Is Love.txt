Our God Is Love


Verse 1
Ev’ry soul ev’ry beating heart
Ev’ry nation and ev’ry tongue
Come find hope in the love of the Father
All creation will bow as one
Lift their eyes see the risen Son
Jesus Saviour forever and after


Chorus
This is love
Jesus came and died and gave His life for us
Let our voices rise and sing for all He's done
Our fear is overcome
Our God is love
Our God is love


Verse 2
Ev’ry distant and broken heart
Ev’ry prayer ev’ry outstretched arm
Finding hope in the love of the Father
Age to age let His praises rise
All the glory for all of time
Jesus Saviour forever and after


Bridge
Age to age we will be singing
In the light of all He's done
All the earth
Ev’ryone singing in the wonder of His love
Age to age we will be singing
In the light of all He's done
All the earth
Ev’ryone singing


Ending
Our God is love
Our God is love
