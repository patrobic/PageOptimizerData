Reign In Us


Verse 1
You thought of us before the world began to breathe
And You knew our names before we came to be
You saw the very day we'd fall away from You
And how desp'rately we need to be redeemed
Lord Jesus come lead us
We're desp'rate for Your touch


Chorus
Oh great and mighty One
With one desire we come
That You would reign
That You would reign in us
We're off'ring up our lives
A living sacrifice
That You would reign
That You would reign in us


Verse 2
Spirit of the living God fall fresh again
Come search our hearts and purify our lives
We need Your perfect love we need Your discipline
We're lost unless You guide us with Your light
Lord Jesus come lead us
We're desp'rate for Your touch


Bridge
We cry out for Your life to refine us
Cry out for Your love to define us
Cry out for Your mercy to keep us
Blameless until You return
