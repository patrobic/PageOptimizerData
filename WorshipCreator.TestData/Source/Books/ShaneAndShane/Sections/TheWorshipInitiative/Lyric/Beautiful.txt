Beautiful


Verse 1
I see Your face in ev'ry sunrise
The colors of the morning are inside Your eyes
The world awakens in the light of the day
I look up to the sky and say
You're beautiful


Verse 2
I see Your power in the moonlit night
Where planets are in motion and galaxies are bright
We are amazed in the light of the stars
It's all proclaiming who You are
You're beautiful


Interlude
You're beautiful


Verse 3
I see You there hanging on a tree
You bled and then You died
And then You rose again for me
Now You are sitting on Your heavenly throne
Soon we will be coming home
You're beautiful


Interlude
You're beautiful
Let's sing it out


Verse 4
When we arrive at eternity's shore
Where death is just a memory and tears are no more
We'll enter in as the wedding bells ring
Your bride will come together and we'll sing
You're beautiful


Interlude
Oh You're beautiful


Ending
I see Your face You're beautiful
You're beautiful You're beautiful
I see Your face You're beautiful
You're beautiful You're beautiful
I see Your face
I see Your face
I see Your face You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
