O Praise Him


Verse 1
Turn your ear to heaven
And hear the noise inside
The sound of angel's awe
The sound of angel's songs
And all this for a King
We could join and sing
All to Christ the King
How constant how divine
This song of ours will rise
O how constant how divine
This love of ours will rise will rise


Chorus 1
O praise Him O praise Him
He is holy
He is holy yeah


Verse 2
Turn your gaze to heaven
And raise a joyous noise
The sound of salvation come
The sound of rescued ones
And all this for a King
Angels join to sing
All for Christ the King
How infinite and sweet
This love so rescuing
O how infinitely sweet
This great love that has redeemed
As one we sing


Chorus 2
Alleluia alleluia
He is holy
He is holy yeah
