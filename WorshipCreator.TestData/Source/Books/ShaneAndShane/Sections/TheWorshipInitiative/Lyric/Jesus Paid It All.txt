Jesus Paid It All


Verse 1
And I hear the Savior say
Thy strength indeed is small
Child of weakness watch and pray
Find in Me thine all in all


Chorus 1
'Cause Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow


Interlude
(It's washed away)
(All my sin and all my shame)


Verse 2
Lord now indeed I find
Thy pow'r and Thine alone
Can change the leper's spots
And melt the heart of stone


Verse 3
And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete
Jesus died my soul to save
My lips shall still repeat


Interlude
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow
He washed it white as snow
He washed it white as snow


Chorus 2
Oh praise the One Who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead
(Jesus)
