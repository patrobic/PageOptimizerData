Beautiful Things


Verse 1
All this pain
I wonder if I'll ever find my way
I wonder if my life could really change
At all


Verse 2
All this earth
Could all that is lost ever be found
Could a garden come up from this ground
At all


Chorus
You make beautiful things
You make beautiful things out of the dust
You make beautiful things
You make beautiful things out of us


Verse 3
All around
Hope is springing up from this old ground
Out of chaos life is being found
In You


Bridge
You make me new You are making me new
You make me new You are making me new
(REPEAT)
