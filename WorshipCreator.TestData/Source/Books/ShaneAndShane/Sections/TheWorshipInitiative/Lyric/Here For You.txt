Here For You


Verse 1
Let our praise be Your welcome
Let our songs be a sign
We are here for You
We are here for You
Let Your breath come from heaven
Fill our hearts with Your life
We are here for You
We are here for You


Chorus
To You our hearts are open
Nothing here is hidden
You are our one desire
You alone are holy
Only You are worthy
God let Your fire fall down


Verse 2
Let our shout be Your anthem
Your renown fill the sky
We are here for You
We are here for You
Let Your Word move in power
Let what's dead come to life
We are here for You
We are here for You


Interlude
Let it fall
Let it fall
Let it fall


Bridge
We welcome You with praise
We welcome You with praise
Almighty God of love
Be welcome in this place
(REPEAT)
Let ev'ry heart adore
Let ev'ry soul awake
Almighty God of love
Be welcome in this place
We welcome You with praise
We welcome You with praise
Almighty God of love
Be welcome in this place


Ending
Be welcome in Your house Lord
Be welcome in Your house
