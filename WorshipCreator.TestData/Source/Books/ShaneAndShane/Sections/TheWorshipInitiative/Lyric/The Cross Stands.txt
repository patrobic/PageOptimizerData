The Cross Stands


Verse 1
Beyond this lifetime
Beyond this darkness there's light
Your cross is shining
So people open your eyes


Chorus
The cross stands above it all
Burning bright in this life
The cross towers over it all
One hope one Deliverer
Saviour reigning high
Above it all above it all


Verse 2
These chains are breaking
Your love is shaking us free
A great awak'ning
This world will finally see


Bridge
Christ has overcome
It is finished He has won
Christ has overcome
We're standing strong
(REPEAT)
