Your Great Name


Verse 1
Lost are saved find their way
At the sound of Your great Name
All condemned feel no shame
At the sound of Your great Name
Ev'ry fear has no place
At the sound of Your great Name
The enemy he has to leave
At the sound of Your great Name


Chorus
Jesus worthy is the Lamb that was slain for us
The Son of God and man
You are high and lifted up
And all the world will praise
Your great Name


Verse 2
All the weak find their strength
At the sound of Your great Name
Hungry souls receive grace
At the sound of Your great Name
The fatherless find their rest
At the sound of Your great Name
The sick are healed the dead are raised
At the sound of Your great Name


Bridge
Redeemer my Healer Lord Almighty
Defender my Savior You are my King
(REPEAT)


Bridge
Sing the Name of Jesus
We worship the Name of Jesus
We bow before Jesus
There is no other Name but Jesus
