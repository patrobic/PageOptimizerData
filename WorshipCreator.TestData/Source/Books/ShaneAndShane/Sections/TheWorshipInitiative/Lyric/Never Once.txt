Never Once


Verse 1
Standing on this mountaintop
Looking just how far we've come
Knowing that for ev'ry step You were with us


Verse 2
Kneeling on this battleground
Seeing just how much You've done
Knowing ev'ry victory was Your pow'r in us


Pre-Chorus
Scars and struggles on the way
But with joy our hearts can say
Yes our hearts can say


Chorus 1
Never once did we ever walk alone
Never once did You leave us on our own
You are faithful God You are faithful
(You are faithful God You are faithful)


Pre-Chorus
Scars and struggles on the way
But with joy our hearts can say
Never once did we ever walk alone
Carried by Your constant grace
Held within Your perfect peace
Never once no we never walk alone


Chorus 2
Never once did we ever walk alone
Never once did You leave us on our own
You are faithful God You are faithful
Ev’ry step we are breathing in Your grace
Evermore we'll be breathing out Your praise
You are faithful God You are faithful


Ending
You are faithful God You are faithful (3X)
