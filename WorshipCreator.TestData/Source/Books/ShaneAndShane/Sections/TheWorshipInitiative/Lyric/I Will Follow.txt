Where You go I'll go
Where You stay I'll stay
When You move I'll move

All Your ways are good
All Your ways are sure
I will trust in You alone
Higher than my sight
High above my life
I will trust in You alone


Chorus
Where You go I'll go
Where You stay I'll stay
When You move I'll move

Light into the world
Light into my life
I will live for You alone
You're the One I seek
Knowing I will find
All I need in You alone
In You alone

In You there's freedom for my soul
In You there's joy unending joy
And I will follow
