Always


Verse 1
My foes are many
They rise against me
But I will hold my ground
I will not fear the war
I will not fear the storm
My help is on the way
My help is on the way


Chorus
Oh my God
He will not delay
My refuge and strength always
I will not fear
His promise is true
My God will come through always
Always


Verse 2
Trouble surrounds me
Chaos abounding
My soul will rest in You
I will not fear the war
I will not fear the storm
My help is on the way
My help is on the way


Bridge
I lift my eyes up
My help comes from the Lord
I lift my eyes up
My help comes from the Lord
(REPEAT)


Ending
Oh my God
He will not delay
My refuge and strength always always
