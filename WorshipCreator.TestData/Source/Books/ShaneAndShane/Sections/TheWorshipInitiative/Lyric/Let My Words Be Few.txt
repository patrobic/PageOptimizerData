Let My Words Be Few


Verse 1
You are God in heaven
And here am I on earth
So I'll let my words be few
Jesus I am so in love with You


Chorus
And I'll stand in awe of You
Yes I'll stand in awe of You
And I'll let my words be few
Jesus I am so in love with You


Verse 2
The simplest of all love songs
I want to bring to You
So I'll let my words be few
Jesus I am so in love with You
