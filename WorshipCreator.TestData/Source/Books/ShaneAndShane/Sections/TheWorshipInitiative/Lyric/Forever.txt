Forever

Give thanks to the Lord
Our God and King
His love endures forever
For He is good He is above all things
His love endures forever
Sing praise sing praise


Verse 2
With a mighty hand
And an outstretched arm
His love endures forever
For the life that's been reborn
His love endures forever
Sing praise sing praise


Pre-Chorus
Sing praise sing praise


Chorus
Forever God is faithful
Forever God is strong
Forever God is with us
Forever forever


Verse 3
From the rising to the setting sun
His love endures forever
And by the grace of God
We will carry on
His love endures forever
Sing praise sing praise
