Oh Lord You're Beautiful


Verse 1
Oh Lord You're beautiful
Your face is all I seek
And when Your eyes are on this child
Your grace abounds to me


Bridge
I want to take Your Word
And shine it all around
First help me just to live it Lord
And when I'm doing well
Help me to never seek a crown
For my reward is giving glory to You


Verse 2
Oh Lord please light the fire
That once burned bright and clear
Replace the lamp of my first love
That burns with holy fear
