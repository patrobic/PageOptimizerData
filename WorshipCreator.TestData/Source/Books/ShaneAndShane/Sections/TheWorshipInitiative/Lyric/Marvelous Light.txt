Marvelous Light


Chorus
Into marvelous light I'm running
Out of darkness out of shame
Through the cross You are the truth
You are the life You are the way


Verse 1
I once was fatherless
A stranger with no hope
Your kindness wakened me
Wakened me from my sleep now
Your love it beckons deeply
A call to come and die
By grace now I will come
And take this life take Your life


Pre-Chorus
Sin has lost its power
Death has lost its sting
From the grave You've risen
Victoriously


Verse 2
My dead heart now is beating
My deepest stains now clean
Your breath fills up my lungs
Now I'm free now I'm free
My dead heart now is beating
My deepest stains now clean
Your breath fills up my lungs
Now I'm free now I'm free


Spoken Words
There's no more shame
No more shame
And now we show the world
Christ in you


Bridge
Lift my hands and spin around
See the light that I have found
Oh the marvelous light marvelous light
(It's Christ in you)
