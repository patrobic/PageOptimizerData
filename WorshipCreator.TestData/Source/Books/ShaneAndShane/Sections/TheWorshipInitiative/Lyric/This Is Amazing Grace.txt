This Is Amazing Grace


Verse 1
Who breaks the power of sin and darkness
Whose love is mighty and so much stronger
The King of Glory the King above all kings


Verse 2
Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder
And leaves us breathless in awe and wonder
The King of Glory the King above all kings


Chorus
(Yeah) (Oh) This is amazing grace
This is unfailing love
That You would take my place
That You would bear my cross
You laid down Your life
That I would be set free
Oh Jesus I sing for all that You've done for me


Verse 3
Who brings our chaos back into order
Who makes the orphan a son and daughter
The King of Glory the King of Glory


Verse 4
Who rules the nations with truth and justice
Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance
The King of Glory the King above all kings



Bridge
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Worthy worthy worthy
