Lead Me To The Cross


Verse 1
Saviour I come quiet my soul
Remember redemption's hill
Where Your blood was spilled
For my ransom


Pre-Chorus
Ev’rything I once held dear
I count it all as loss


Chorus
Lead me to the cross
Where Your love poured out
Bring me to my knees
Lord I lay me down
Rid me of myself
I belong to You
Oh lead me lead me to the cross


Verse 2
You were as I tempted and tried human
The word became flesh
Bore my sin in death
Now You're risen


Bridge
To Your heart
To Your heart
Lead me to Your heart
Lead me to Your heart
