Healer


Verse
You hold my every moment
You calm my raging seas
You walk with me through fire
And heal all my disease


Pre-Chorus
I trust in You
I trust in You


Chorus
I believe You're my healer
I believe You are all I need
I believe You're my portion
I believe You're more than enough for me
Jesus You're all I need


Bridge
Nothing is impossible for You
Nothing is impossible
Nothing is impossible for You
You hold my world in Your hands
(REPEAT)


Interlude
More than enough for me
Jesus You're all I need
(REPEAT)
More than enough for me
