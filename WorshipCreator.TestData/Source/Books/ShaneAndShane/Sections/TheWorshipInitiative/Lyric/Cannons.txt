Cannons


Verse 1
It's falling from the clouds
A strange and lovely sound
I hear it in the thunder and the rain
It's ringing in the skies
Like cannons in the night
The music of the universe plays


Chorus 1
(We're singing) You are holy great and mighty
The moon and the stars declare who You are
I'm so unworthy but still You love me
Forever my heart will sing of how great You are


Verse 2
Beautiful and free
The song of galaxies
Reaching far beyond the Milky Way
Let's join in with the sound
Come on let's sing it out
As the music of the universe plays


Chorus 2
(We're singing) You are holy great and mighty
The moon and the stars declare who You are
I'm so unworthy but still You love me
Forever my heart will sing of You


Bridge
All glory honor power is Yours amen
All glory honor power is Yours amen
All glory honor power is Yours forever amen
